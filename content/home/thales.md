I am a co-founder -- together with the writer  Apostolos Doxiadis and the school teacher and writer Tefcros Michaelides of the not-for-profit organisation
[**Thales and Friends**](http://thalesandfriends.org/). For the very active Greek site see the [**Greek language version**](http://thalesandfriends.org/el/).
Thales + Friends works to bridge the chasm between mathematics and other forms of cultural activity.	To achieve its aims, Thales + Friends works to create opportunities for interdisciplinary research and communication, through lectures, discussions, publications, and reading groups.  Some international activities include:

- [**Mykonos conference: Mathematics and narrative**](http://thalesandfriends.org/mykonos-conference/).	See the related article in [**Nature**](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02987152)

- [**Delphi Conference: Circles Disturbed**](http://thalesandfriends.org/delphi-conference/). See the proceedings of the conference  in this [**book**](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9764.html) edited by 
Apostolos Doxiadis and Barry Mazur.
